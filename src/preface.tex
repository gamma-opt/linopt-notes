\section*{Preface}

These notes comprise the compilations of lecture notes prepared for teaching Linear Optimisatio and Integer Optimisation at Aalto University, Department of Mathematics and Systems Analysis, since 2017.

These notes are mostly based on these references:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Bertsimas, Dimitris, and John N. Tsitsiklis. Introduction to linear optimization. Vol. 6. Belmont, MA: Athena Scientific, 1997.}
    \item \textit{Wolsey, Laurence A. Integer programming. John Wiley & Sons, 2020.}
\end{itemize}

Among the years, errors and typos have been found and introduced as the notes evolve. It is likely that some still exists. If so please feel free to open an issue in the its github repository and report it or make a pull request proposing a fix.

These notes have been prepared with the help of a number of students over the years. I am imensely grateful for their support and dedication to this material and teaching of this course.
